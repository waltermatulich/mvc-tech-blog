When users first visit the CMS-style blog site, they encounter the homepage, which showcases existing blog posts if any have been published. Navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard, along with the option to log in, greet them. Clicking on the homepage option seamlessly redirects them to the homepage. However, if users decide to explore other links in the navigation, they are prompted to either sign up or sign in, ensuring access control and personalized interactions.

Upon choosing to sign up, users are prompted to create a username and password. Once they submit their credentials, their information is securely saved, and they are automatically logged into the site. Returning visitors who choose to sign in are prompted to enter their username and password, ensuring a secure login process. Once signed in, users are presented with navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out, ensuring ease of navigation and access to essential functionalities.

Within the signed-in environment, users can navigate to the homepage to explore existing blog posts, click on individual posts to view details and leave comments, or access their dashboard to manage their own posts. From the dashboard, users can add new blog posts, update existing ones, or delete them as desired. Finally, when users choose to log out, they are securely signed out of the site, maintaining privacy and security. Additionally, if users remain idle on the site for an extended period, they may be automatically logged out for security reasons, ensuring the protection of their account and data.
